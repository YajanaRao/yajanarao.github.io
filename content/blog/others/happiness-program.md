- Responsibility is power

- You must practice sadhana along with (spiritual practice) seva (service). They go together and your ego will increase if you do one without the other. Through sadhana love and joy blossoms inside you and service is an expression of that love and joy within in.

- The entire universe is a play of the same energy.

- The whole universe is an extension of me. (SOHUM)

\*Love is your very existence, you cannot find it outside of yourself. You love someone because they are beautiful, intelligent, educated etc.—this is conditional love. When you love someone as they are, that is divine love. Nature loves you, your pets love you. The more you feel gratitude the more love blossoms in you. If you are thankful grace flows more and more. Meditation is feeling the love with in.

- Desires are an endless cycle of suffering.

- Being in love with yourself then you are in love with everyone.

- Work is worship. Stop seeking joy in action and joy becomes action—this is karma yoga.

- It is your responsibility to cultivate your growth.

- The difference between a problem and an adventure if your attitude and your outlook.

- Try to eat sattvic food!
  Mindful Eating exercise with the grape (Eat every bite as if it is your last)

- You can only give what you have. If you have love and happiness then you can give it and these are within.

- Accept everyone but you remain centered and then only you act.

- You can’t change others, you can only change yourself.
