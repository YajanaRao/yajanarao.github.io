## Being Simply Beautiful

Stuff everywhere! Bags, clothes, cars, iPads. We love our stuff. And over time, we’ve come to believe that this 'stuff' is what defines who we are. But our possessions will never fully satisfy the inmost desires of our soul. They never have. And they are not about to start. In fact, most of the time, it distract us from the very things that bring meaning to our lives.

Instead, our lives are defined by the choices we make. It is these choices that define our character, our authentic self. So choose wisely. Do not miss out by placing importance on things instead of people. Pursue beauty, hope, love and kindness. Pursue opportunity to improve this world for somebody else. Let’s be simply beautiful.

## Invest time on timeless

"Sure, to be successful, we have to have some sense of what’s happening in the world. But we shouldn’t live and die by that. It’s far better to be rooted in something deeper, something less urgent, more timeless. Keep a finger on the pulse of today, but remember most of the trends of today will tomorrow sound like the trends of yesterday. So let’s continue to invest most of our time, attention, and trust in ideas, tools, and art that is outside of time."

## A Morning Offering

May my mind come alive today
To the invisible geography
That invites me to new frontiers,
To break the dead shell of yesterdays,
To risk being disturbed and changed.
​
May I have the courage today
To live the life that I would love,
To postpone my dream no longer
But do at last what I came here for
And waste my heart on fear no more.​
​
— John O’Donohue



Muscles without strength, 
friendship without trust, 
opinion without risk, 
change without aesthetics, 
age without values, 
food without nourishment, 
power without fairness, 
facts without rigor, 
degrees without erudition, 
militarism without fortitude, 
progress without civilization, 
complication without depth, 
fluency without content; these are the sins to remember.

~ Nassim Taleb
