## Space-Time-Bridging

The meditation method Space-Time-Bridging was created by neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman and helps you get present (as in calm and alert), optimize your focus to get the right things done and access an inspired, hyper-creative state of mind.

Complete each step while connecting it to one breath. Repeat the three steps as long as you want, at least 3 minutes.

1. Sense Your Brain
   Breathe (in): “Internalize” your attention, gently placing it on a point inside your head, e.g. your third eye or the point between your eyes.

2. Focus
   Breathe (out): Open your eyes and focus your gaze on a single point closeby, e.g. on your hand.

3. Defocus
   Breathe (in): See the whole picture at once; relax your eyes and take in everything in your field of vision.
