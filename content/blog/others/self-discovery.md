"Most people go to their graves with music still in them"- Oliver Windall Holmes

We have 86400 seconds every day, like that we have many hundred days in our life. In that period we will do some or other thing.  so the question is were we doing the thing that is really what we wanted?, are we harvesting as much as possible from the land of life?, will we feel the self-satisfaction at the end of it, or we will be a disappointed soul.


These all questions arises because we know very little about our self. We are not living a life that we wanted we are living a the life that what others expecting from us. We will have food according to our standard not taste, we will wear dresses according to reputation not comfort, We will make friends according to our level not interest. In all expectations of live we are living others life. what others are thinking will always stands as the first preference before doing any work. subtracting all the work we do for other will we do any thing for our sake?.

According to a study even in our closest person mind we will only be 0.01% of their thinking, by this i don't feel any value in trying to satisfy others.

Spend much of your time with yourself. search for deep hidden amazing person in you. you got to find the hopes, dreams, strengths, weakness of us.we have to understand where we have been and where we are going to.Ever step we take every decision we make must be informed by our Authentic self and only for our-selves alone.

Don't let the voice of other people to suppress your inner voice. Trust yourself, create the kind of life , you will be happy to live with all yourself. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement

"Life is no brief candle for me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I got hold of for the moment,and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations" -George Bernard Shaw
