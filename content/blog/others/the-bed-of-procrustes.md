- Most people fear being without audiovisual stimulation because they are too repetitive when they think and imagine things on their own.
- The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor; the fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich.
- You don’t become completely free by just avoiding to be a slave; you also need to avoid becoming a master.
- You will be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt.

- We are hunters; we are only truly alive in those moments when we improvise; no schedule, just small surprises and stimuli from the environment.
- You need to keep reminding yourself of the obvious: charm lies in the unsaid, the unwritten, and the undisplayed. It takes mastery to control silence.

- Happiness; we don’t know what it means, how to measure it, or how to reach it, but we know extremely well how to avoid unhappiness.
- To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.
- For the classics, philosophical insight was the product of a life of leisure; for me, a life of leisure is the product of philosophical insight.
- The weak shows his strength and hides his weaknesses; the magnificent exhibits his weaknesses like ornaments.
- The mediocre regret their words more than their silence; finer men regret their silence more than their words; the magnificent has nothing to regret.
- The classical man’s worst fear was inglorious death; the modern man’s worst fear is just death.
- You know you have influence when people start noticing your absence more than the presence of others.
