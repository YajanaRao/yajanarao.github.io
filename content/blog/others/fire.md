## Financial idependence:

- Money work for you instead you working for money.
- Passive income should be more than active income.
- Not dependent on 9 to 5 job for income.

Those seeking to attain FIRE intentionally maximize their savings rate by finding ways to increase income and/or decrease expenses.

## 50-30-20 Rule:

Income-
50% for needs
30% for wants
20% for Savings

## Extreme savings rule:

50% - 70% Savings.

Frugality: Think twice before spending.

## Generate passive income

Lean fire:

Live on bare minimum and save on rest.
