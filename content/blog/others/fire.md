## Financial independence or Financial Freedom:

- Money work for you instead you working for money.
- Passive income should be more than active income.
- Not dependent on 9 to 5 job for income.
- Your income should not depend upon you.
- Income diversification ( Multiple sources of Income )

Those seeking to attain FIRE intentionally maximize their savings rate by finding ways to increase income and/or decrease expenses.

## 50-30-20 Rule:

Income-
50% for needs
30% for wants
20% for Savings

## Extreme savings rule:

50% - 70% Savings.

Frugality: Think twice before spending.

## Generate passive income

Lean fire:

Live on bare minimum and save on rest.

> Youâ€™re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

Get paid by the value you bring. Not by the time

## Stocks

A stock or share (also known as a company's "equity") is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation and represents a proportionate claim on its assets (what it owns) and earnings (what it generates in profits).

- Dont put all eggs in one basket
- Always buy in SIP mode. If you want to invest 50k in Infosys(For example). Then buy in 50:20:20:10 ratio or any ratio that you wish. So you can buy on dip or breakout
- Invest in the shares who are market leaders of their sector.
