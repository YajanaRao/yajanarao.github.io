## Financial independence or Financial Freedom:

- Money work for you instead you working for money.
- Passive income should be more than active income.
- Not dependent on 9 to 5 job for income.
- Your income should not depend upon you.
- Income diversification ( Multiple sources of Income )

Those seeking to attain FIRE intentionally maximize their savings rate by finding ways to increase income and/or decrease expenses.

## 50-30-20 Rule:

Income-
50% for needs
30% for wants
20% for Savings

Needs are those without which you cannot sustain your daily life. These are groceries, house rent or EMI, utilities, and so on. You can never compromise on needs, and you have no choice but to spend on them. 

Wants are those that are not absolutely necessary, but you are making use of them in order to make your life better. A few examples of these are gym membership, vacation, movie tickets, subscriptions to online streaming sites, and so on. It is advisable for anyone to limit their spending on wants as much as possible.

The remaining 20% of your income must be saved to build an emergency corpus which is at least thrice your monthly salary. Once that is done, you can start investing. Therefore, your investments in mutual funds should be 20% of your monthly salary. If you are able to cut down on spending on wants, then you can utilise the same in increasing your mutual fund investment.

## Extreme savings rule:

50% - 70% Savings.

Frugality: Think twice before spending.

## Generate passive income

Lean fire:

Live on bare minimum and save on rest.

> Youâ€™re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

Get paid by the value you bring. Not by the time
