## Lena Hue So

If you wish to receive, receive now 
for this is the moment to receive, oh brother!
Having come here as a human being, Don't miss the chance to receive!
This life, like a precious gem, is not easy to come across
Stumbing through infinite cycles, you may never find this gem again!

These fine words you boast, do you live by them ?
What is the point of such knowledge and morale, if you don't live by it!
Will you not remain joyless ? Will you not remain Lost, in eternal search?
This human life is a precious gem, that you may never come across again!
Having come here as a human being, Don't miss the chance to receive!

You have come here as a swan, so walk here with the Gait of a Swan!
It is time to dwell the depths of life, no more shallow puddles!
The seeker's being will be filled with radiance
As he plays this game of life alone
This life, like a precious gem, is not easy to come across

When Grace was showered, the deal was struck.
What does the thirst for respect and fame mean anymore?
Says faqir, I have found that invaluable jewel
I have given up all that I am, and have become immortal

This life, like a precious gem, is not easy to come across
Having come here as a human being, Don't miss the chance to receive!

This life, like a precious gem, is not easy to come across
If you wish to receive, receive now 
for this is the moment to receive, oh brother!

~ Sufi Rohal Faqir
