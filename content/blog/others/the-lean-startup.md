>> There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all ~ Peter Drucker

- Startup is a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

- Startup success is not a consequence of good genes or being in the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered by following the right process.

- The lean startup takes it's name from the leaning manufacturing revolution that Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo are credited with developing at Tayota.

- The lean startup methodology is based on the customer development methodology.

- Lean startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable; this is achieved by adopting a combination of business hypothesis driven experimentation, iterative product releases and validated learning.

- Learn startup emphasizes customer feedback over intuition and flexibility over planning

- Every startup in any industry is a grand experiment. The question is not "Can this product we built ?".  Instead "Should this product be built ?"

## Principles

- Build Measure Learn


- Minimum Viable Product

Version of a new product which allows a team to cllect the maximum amount of validated learning about the customer with least effort.

- Continuous deployment 

All the code written for an application is immediately deployed in production.

- Split testing (A/B testing)

Different versions of the product offered to the customers at the same time. Should be done parallel testing.

- Actionable metrics

Actionable metrics can lead to informed business decisions and subsequent actions. 

- Pivot

Structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy and engine of growth.

- Innovation accounting

## Take aways

- Small batches

Small batches permit us to deliver results faster, with higher quality and less stress.

- Five Whys

The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" five times.
