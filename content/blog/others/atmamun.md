> The moment that man gains freedom from his mind, he becomes a living, breathing God! — Kapil Gupta, MD


Atmamun means mind of the spirit. In every worthwhile experiences are when there is no mind. People call it as Flow state, The Zone Or Japanese call it as Mushin. No mind is the gateway to atmamun.

This book helps us to understand, what is mind and ways of transcending the mind by understanding it to become a Atmamun.

This book explores 
1. What is mind ? 
2. Why Worship A God ?
3. How to become God ?
4. What is self ?
5. What is Thought ?
6. What is life ?
7. What is Meditation ?

The book is written in conversation way. This is a kind of book I would like to re read quite offen.

Below are few highlights from the book: 

### 1. What is Atmamun?


- The Sanskrit translation of Atmamun is “Mind of the Spirit.” 
- All of us are controlled by the mind.
- **Man’s greatest dilemma is that he lives in a prison and he believes that he is free**.
- The man who knows that he lives in a prison will find a way to break free of it. But the one who believes that he is free while being imprisoned will remained
imprisoned forever.
- When you have likes and dislikes, you have a desire for one thing and an aversion for another.
- For most humans current existance consists of following:

### 2. What Is The Mind?

- The life that you are experiencing is not being experienced directly by you. It is being experienced by you through the filter of the mind. In fact, this filter is also a projector. The mind creates the entirety of the scene that you experience.
- The pride of religion is more detrimental than the pride of ego. The boastfulness of morality is more sinister than the boastfulness of financial wealth. The high of altruism is no more evolved than the high of substance abuse. It is a façade created
- Man will take any opportunity to avoid that which is most immediate in his life. He will do anything but the task at hand. He will look at anything besides that which stands inches from his face.
- Belief is a useless concept. There is only knowing and not knowing.
- Do whatever you wish, freely and completely. Without the guilt of morality. Or the burden of should’s and shouldn’ts.


### 3. Become God Or Give Yourself To One
- The human being who is consumed with a particular vision does not allow “possibility” to stand in his or her way.
- Knowledge is a cop out. It is a token demonstration of passing interest. It is a clever little game. For while it may fill the head, it leaves the heart empty. The one and only thing that a thirsty man seeks is to quench his thirst. Unless his thirst is quenched, it is all useless small talk. Is it not?
- If you are asking for no less than God himself, you must give no less than your Entire Self.

### 4. Your Manufactured Self

- For your entire life, you have lived as a slave to this person in the mirror. And it has destroyed your life.

### 5. You Are Not YOU

- The life that you are currently living is not your real life. Because you are living through the Sheath known as Mind.
- The Ego is Not that which says that you are great. It is that which says that you Exist at all!

### 6. Aren’t You Tired Of YOU?

- The greatest freedom that we have is the freedom to walk away from ourselves.
- The person that you call “myself” is the source of all your miseries. Remove this manufactured self, and you will be as free as a living God.

### 7. Is Your Life Really A Life? . . . Really?

- The greatest price is the life he was born with. That deep, nameless, pulsating vibration that spawns breath in his lungs and consciousness within his being. **The life that existed before the life he attempted to create.**

### 8. Life Is Not What You Believe It To Be

- If you are happy, don’t get too excited, for misery is just around the corner. And if you are unhappy, fear not, for happiness is on its way.
- This is the purgatory of man. To live vacillating between opposite poles of emotion. Living in This whilst hoping for That. Loving This whilst hating That.
- Live your life as a lonely stranger. As a wanderer filled with awe and wonder.
- Leave everything as you found it. For none of it belongs to you.
- If there is one truth that I have learned, it is that unless you find it inside of Today, you will never find it inside of Tomorrow.

### 9. Life Is The Ultimate Absurdity

- You can create anything you wish In your life. But you will never make anything Out Of life. For life will always be life. Meaningless. Innocent. And Indefinable.
- And you will enjoy every bit of the journey, if and only if you understand that none of it means anything.

### 10. Life Is Not A Wishing Well

- Life is as raw as all forces of nature. And what we perhaps must realize is that our suffering comes from expecting it to be that which it can never be.

### 11. Life Is Not What You Think

- Life is simply a joke. An absurdity. A non-linear, haphazard, and unpredictable trail that is fertile for the imagination of hallucinatory human beings.

    ```
    Life is the leaf that falls and tumbles onto a bed of leaves.
    Life is the dog that barks in the distance.
    Life is a breeze which blows through your hair.
    Life is the very thing that you ignore every day.
    Life is the most insignificant event of the hour.
    Life is not a series of events. Rather it is the substrate in which the events
    take place.
    ```

- My friend, there was a day that you were not here. And there will soon be a day when you are no longer here. And once you realize this, you will understand that all there is left to do is play.
