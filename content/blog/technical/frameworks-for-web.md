Framework is for organizing thoughts not the code or files. Most of us fall in love with solving problems. So we end up creating new problems to solve in places where even there is no problem to solve. I would like to use my blog to create a framework to organize my thoughts. I have used gatsby now. The problem had been that third party frameworks will lock us to a pattern and lots of code which is not what we need in the first place.


### Web primitives

There is a growing trend towards using web primitives again. This is because web primitives offer a number of advantages, including performance, SEO, accessibility, and simplicity.

Web primitives are the basic building blocks of the web. They are the underlying technologies that power web browsers and web servers.

Here are some specific examples of how developers are going back to web primitives:

- Remix is a full-stack web framework that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It uses web primitives like server-side rendering and forms to build high-performance and accessible web apps.

- Next.js is a React framework that supports both server-side rendering and static site generation. This allows developers to choose the best way to render their web app for each page.

- Svelte is a JavaScript framework that is known for its small size and fast performance. It uses web primitives like forms and custom elements to build web apps.
