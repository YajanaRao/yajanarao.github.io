## Under SOLID design principle

SOLID is a popular set of design principles that are used in object-oriented software development. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: 
- **Single responsibility principle**

    A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

- **Open-closed principle**

    You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior without modifying it. Or simply open for extension and closed for modification.
- **Liskov substitution principle**
- **Interface segregation principle** 
- **Dependency inversion principle** 

    Developer should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
    high level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
