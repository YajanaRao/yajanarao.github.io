## Unit - 1

## 1) Define the terms

### Data

- Raw facts about things and events
- Data is a relative entity or object. Ex-name, age, class.
- Data contains raw data and events. there are two types of data.
  1.  Convetional data
      Names, Adress etc
  2.  Unconventional data
      Media, Images maps and drawings

### Database System

Data base system is nothing but database and DBMS software together we call as data base system.

### Database Management System

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that manages the database structure and controls access to the data stored in the database

### Database

Database is any collection of electronic records that can be processed to produce useful information.

### Metadata

It is information about structure of each file, type and storage format of each data and various constraints on the data is called meta-data.

### Data independence

The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS catalog separately from the access programs is known as program – data independence.

### Data model

A data model (or datamodel) is **an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another** and to the properties of real-world entities.

### Schema constructs

Each **element** of a schema is known as a schema construct.

### Snapshot

A database snapshot is **a read-only, static view of a SQL Server database**

### Database administrator

A Database Administrator (DBA) is **individual or person responsible for controlling, maintenance, coordinating, and operation of database management system**

### Distributed Processing

Distributed processing is **the use of more than one processor to perform the processing for an individual task**. Examples of distributed processing in Oracle database systems appear

### Characteristics of database

- Persistant
- Shared and
- Interelated.

## 2) Explain with neat diagram the operation of a two - tier client server architecture for RDBMS.

## What is Database Architecture?

A Database Architecture is a representation of DBMS design. It helps to design, develop, implement, and maintain the database management system. A DBMS architecture allows dividing the database system into individual components that can be independently modified, changed, replaced, and altered. It also helps to understand the components of a database.

**Types of DBMS Architecture**

- 1-Tier Architecture (Single Tier Architecture)

- 2-Tier Architecture

- 3-Tier Architecture

### 1-Tier Architecture

1 Tier Architecture in DBMS is the simplest architecture of Database in which the client, server, and Database all reside on the same machine. A simple one tier architecture example would be anytime you install a Database in your system and access it to practice SQL queries. But such architecture is rarely used in production.

### 2-Tier Architecture

A 2 Tier Architecture in DBMS is a Database architecture where the presentation layer runs on a client (PC, Mobile, Tablet, etc.), and data is stored on a server called the second tier. Two tier architecture provides added security to the DBMS as it is not exposed to the end-user directly. It also provides direct and faster communication.

![2-tier-architecture](https://cdn.guru99.com/images/1/091318_0745_DBMSArchite2.png)

In the above 2 Tier client-server architecture of database management system, we can see that one server is connected with clients 1, 2, and 3.

**Two Tier Architecture Example**:

A Contact Management System created using MS- Access.

### 3-Tier Architecture

A 3 Tier Architecture in DBMS is the most popular client server architecture in DBMS in which the development and maintenance of functional processes, logic, data access, data storage, and user interface is done independently as separate modules. Three Tier architecture contains a presentation layer, an application layer, and a database server.

3-Tier database Architecture design is an extension of the 2-tier client-server architecture. A 3-tier architecture has the following layers:

1.  Presentation layer (your PC, Tablet, Mobile, etc.)

2.  Application layer (server)

3.  Database Server

![3-tier-architecture](https://cdn.guru99.com/images/1/091318_0745_DBMSArchite3.png)

The Application layer resides between the user and the DBMS, which is responsible for communicating the user's request to the DBMS system and send the response from the DBMS to the user. The application layer(business logic layer) also processes functional logic, constraint, and rules before passing data to the user or down to the DBMS.

The goal of Three Tier client-server architecture is:

- To separate the user applications and physical database

- To support DBMS characteristics

- Program-data independence

- Supporting multiple views of the data

**Three Tier Architecture Example:**

Any large website on the internet, including www.google.com.

## 3) What are the responsibilities of DBA and database designers?

Database administrators (DBAs) use specialized software to store and organize data. The role may include capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, as well as backup and data recovery.

Duties and responsibilities:

- Manage SQL Server databases.

- Configure and maintain database servers and processes.

- Monitor system's health and performance.

- Ensure high levels of performance, availability, sustainability and security.

- Analyze, solve, and correct issues in real time.

- DBA’s don’t have to know anything about the content of the database, but they need to make sure that there is adequate CPU, disk, memory, and network bandwidth available, that appropriate backups are being taken (and checked periodically). They should monitor system loads and let the developers/designers know when the system is being overtaxed.

- Database designers/developers work with the end users to make sure that the database holds all the information that the users need. They also need to design physical tables and indexes to ensure that queries execute as quickly as required. They tell the DBA’s how much space they need to start with, and how fast tables/indexes are expected to grow.

- If queries (screens and reports) are not running fast enough, the designers/developers need to check for bottlenecks in their code, and the DBA’s need to check for bottlenecks in memory, I/O, or the network. The designers may need to create new indexes, or add statistics to the database so that queries execute faster - these objects will need space from the DBA’s, and maybe changes to table definitions to create/update statistics.

## 4) With a diagram, explain the functions and components of DBMS and their interactions.

### Components of DBMS

In order to facilitate these functions, DBMS has the following key components:

_Software_. DBMS is primarily a software system that can be considered as a management console or an interface to interact with and manage databases. The interfacing also spreads across real-world physical systems that contribute data to the backend databases. The OS, networking software, and the hardware infrastructure is involved in creating, accessing, managing, and processing the databases.

_Hardware_. Consists of a set of physical electronic devices such as computers, I/O devices, storage devices, etc., this provides the interface between computers and the real world systems.

_Data_. DBMS contains operational data, access to database records and metadata as a resource to perform the necessary functionality. The data may include files with such as index files, administrative information, and data dictionaries used to represent data flows, ownership, structure, and relationships to other records or objects.

_Procedures_. While not a part of the DBMS software, procedures can be considered as instructions on using DBMS. The documented guidelines assist users in designing, modifying, managing, and processing databases.

_Database languages_. These are components of the DBMS used to access, modify, store, and retrieve data items from databases; specify database schema; control user access; and perform other associated database management operations. Types of DBMS languages include Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Database Access Language (DAL) and Data Control Language (DCL).

_Query processor_. As a fundamental component of the DBMS, the query processor acts as an intermediary between users and the DBMS data engine in order to communicate query requests. When users enter an instruction in SQL language, the command is executed from the high-level language instruction to a low-level language that the underlying machine can understand and process to perform the appropriate DBMS functionality. In addition to instruction parsing and translation, the query processor also optimizes queries to ensure fast processing and accurate results.

_Runtime database manager_. A centralized management component of DBMS that handles functionality associated with runtime data, which is commonly used for context-based database access. This component checks for user authorization to request the query; processes the approved queries; devises an optimal strategy for query execution; supports concurrency so that multiple users can simultaneously work on same databases; and ensures integrity of data recorded into the databases.

_Database manager_. Unlike the runtime database manager that handles queries and data at runtime, the database manager performs DBMS functionality associated with the data within databases. Database manager allows a set of commands to perform different DBMS operations that include creating, deleting, backup, restoring, cloning, and other database maintenance tasks. The database manager may also be used to update the database with patches from vendors.

_Database engine_. This is the core software component within the DBMS solution that performs the core functions associated with data storage and retrieval. A database engine is also accessible via APIs that allow users or apps to create, read, write, and delete records in databases.

_Reporting_. The report generator extracts useful information from DBMS files and displays it in structured format based on defined specifications. This information may be used for further analysis, decision making, or business intelligence.

## 5) List the advantages and disadvantages of DBMS. Discuss any five advantages by comparing with file systems.

### Advantages of Database Management System (DBMS)

1.  Improved data sharing

An advantage of the database management approach is, the DBMS helps to create an environment in which end users have better access to more and better-managed data.

Such access makes it possible for end users to respond quickly to changes in their environment.

2.  Improved data security

The more users access the data, the greater the risks of data security breaches. Corporations invest considerable amounts of time, effort, and money to ensure that corporate data are used properly. A DBMS provides a framework for better enforcement of data privacy and security policies.

3.  Better data integration

Wider access to well-managed data promotes an integrated view of the organization’s operations and a clearer view of the big picture. It becomes much easier to see how actions in one segment of the company affect other segments.

4.  Minimized data inconsistency

Data inconsistency exists when different versions of the same data appear in different places. For example, data inconsistency exists when a company’s sales department stores a sales representative’s name as “Bill Brown” and the company’s personnel department stores that same person’s name as “William G. Brown,” or when the company’s regional sales office shows the price of a product as $45.95 and its national sales office shows the same product’s price as $43.95. The probability of data inconsistency is greatly reduced in a properly designed database.

5.  Improved data access

The DBMS makes it possible to produce quick answers to ad hoc queries. From a database perspective, a query is a specific request issued to the DBMS for data manipulation—for example, to read or update the data. Simply put, a query is a question, and an ad hoc query is a spur-of-the-moment question. The DBMS sends back an answer (called the query result set) to the application. For example, end users, when dealing with large amounts of sales data, might want quick answers to questions (ad hoc queries) such as:

    -  What was the dollar volume of sales by product during the past six months?

    -  What is the sales bonus figure for each of our salespeople during the past three months?

    -  How many of our customers have credit balances of 3,000 or more?

6.  Improved decision making

Better-managed data and improved data access make it possible to generate better-quality information, on which better decisions are based. The quality of the information generated depends on the quality of the underlying data. Data quality is a comprehensive approach to promoting the accuracy, validity, and timeliness of the data. While the DBMS does not guarantee data quality, it provides a framework to facilitate data quality initiatives.

7.  Increased end-user productivity

The availability of data, combined with the tools that transform data into usable information, empowers end users to make quick, informed decisions that can make the difference between success and failure in the global economy.

Till now we have seen different benefits of database management systems. But it has certain limitations or disadvantages.

Let's find various disadvantages of database system.

### Disadvantages of Database Management System (DBMS):

Although the database system yields considerable advantages over previous data management approaches, database systems do carry significant disadvantages. For example:

1.  Increased costs

one of the disadvantages of dbms is Database systems require sophisticated hardware and software and highly skilled personnel. The cost of maintaining the hardware, software, and personnel required to operate and manage a database system can be substantial. Training, licensing, and regulation compliance costs are often overlooked when database systems are implemented.

2.  Management complexity

Database systems interface with many different technologies and have a significant impact on a company’s resources and culture. The changes introduced by the adoption of a database system must be properly managed to ensure that they help advance the company’s objectives. Given the fact that database systems hold crucial company data that are accessed from multiple sources, security issues must be assessed constantly.

3.  Maintaining currency

To maximize the efficiency of the database system, you must keep your system current. Therefore, you must perform frequent updates and apply the latest patches and security measures to all components.

Because database technology advances rapidly, personnel training costs tend to be significant. Vendor dependence. Given the heavy investment in technology and personnel training, companies might be reluctant to change database vendors.

As a consequence, vendors are less likely to offer pricing point advantages to existing customers, and those customers might be limited in their choice of database system components.

4.  Frequent upgrade/replacement cycles

DBMS vendors frequently upgrade their products by adding new functionality. Such new features often come bundled in new upgrade versions of the software. Some of these versions require hardware upgrades. Not only do the upgrades themselves cost money, but it also costs money to train database users and administrators to properly use and manage the new features.

### Advantage of File-oriented system:

1.  Backup:

It is possible to take faster and automatic back-up of database stored in files of computer-based systems.

computer systems provide functionalities to serve this purpose. It is also possible to develop specific application program for this purpose.

2.  Compactness:

It is possible to store data compactly.

3.  Data Retrieval:

Computer-based systems provide enhanced data retrieval techniques to retrieve data stored in files in easy and efficient way.

4.  Editing:

It is easy to edit any information stored in computers in form of files.

Specific application programs or editing software can be used for this purpose.

5.  Remote Access:

In computer-based systems,it is possible to access data remotely.

so,to access data it is not necessary for a user to remain present at location where these data are kept.

6.  Sharing:

Data stored in files of computer-based systems ca be shared among multiple users at a same time.

### Drawbacks of File system

1.  Data redundancy:

Data redundancy refers to the duplication of data, lets say we are managing the data of a college where a student is enrolled for two courses, the same student details in such case will be stored twice, which will take more storage than needed. Data redundancy often leads to higher storage costs and poor access time.

2.  Data inconsistency:

Data redundancy leads to data inconsistency, lets take the same example that we have taken above, a student is enrolled for two courses and we have student address stored twice, now lets say student requests to change his address, if the address is changed at one place and not on all the records then this can lead to data inconsistency.

Data Isolation: Because data are scattered in various files, and files may be in different formats, writing new application programs to retrieve the appropriate data is difficult.

Dependency on application programs:

Changing files would lead to change in application programs.

3.  Atomicity issues:

Atomicity of a transaction refers to “All or nothing”, which means either all the operations in a transaction executes or none.

For example: Lets say Steve transfers 100$ to Negan’s account. This transaction consists multiple operations such as debit 100$ from Steve’s account, credit 100$ to Negan’s account. Like any other device, a computer system can fail lets say it fails after first operation then in that case Steve’s account would have been debited by 100$ but the amount was not credited to Negan’s account, in such case the rollback of operation should occur to maintain the atomicity of transaction. It is difficult to achieve atomicity in file processing systems.

4.  Data Security:

Data should be secured from unauthorised access, for example a student in a college should not be able to see the payroll details of the teachers, such kind of security constraints are difficult to apply in file processing systems.

## 6) What are the main characteristics of the database over the file processing approach?

### Characteristics of the Database Approach

There are different characteristics of the database approach from the much older approach of programming with files. In a traditional file processing system, each user defines and implements its own modifications to the files needed for a selected software application as a part of programming the appliance. In the database approach, one repository maintains data which is defined once then accessed by various users in that database. In a file system, it will be independently like an application that is free to name elements. In comparison, during a database, the names or labels of knowledge are defined once and used repeatedly by queries, transactions, and applications.

Characteristics of database approach :

Some of the most important characteristics of the database approach to the file processing approach are the following as follows.

Approach-1 :

Self-Describing Nature of a Database System :

One of the most fundamental characteristics of the database approach is that the database system contains not only the database itself but also an entire definition or description of the database structure and constraints also known as metadata of the database.

This definition is stored within the DBMS catalog, which contains information like the structure of every file, the sort and storage format of every data item, and various constraints/rules on the information.

The knowledge stored within the catalog is named meta-data, and it describes the structure of the first database The catalog is employed by the DBMS software and also by database users such as database administrators who required to know the information about the database structure.

A general-purpose DBMS software package is not written for a selected database application. Therefore, it must ask the catalog to understand the structure of the files during a specific database, like the sort and format of knowledge it will access.

The DBMS software must work equally well with any number of database applications, For example, a university database, a banking database, or a corporation database as long as because the database definition is stored within the catalog In traditional file processing, data definition is usually a part of the files. File processing software can access only specific databases, Database Management software can access various databases by extracting the database definitions or schemas from the catalog and using these definitions.

Approach-2 :

Isolation between Programs and Data, and Data Abstraction :

In a traditional file processing system, the structure of database knowledge files is embedded within the application programs, so any changes to the structure of a file may require changing all programs that access that file.

Against this, DBMS access programs don’t require such changes in most cases, so independence is achieved between them.

The structure of knowledge files is stored within the DBMS catalog separately from the programs that access them. We call this property program-data independence.

The characteristic that allows program-data independence and program-operation independence is known as data abstraction.

A DBMS provides users with a conceptual representation of knowledge that doesn’t include much of the small print of how the information is stored or how the operations are implemented internally. Informally, a knowledge model may be a sort of data abstraction that won’t provide this conceptual representation.

The information model uses logical concepts, like objects, their properties, and their relationships between them, which will be easier for many users to know than memory concepts or storage concepts. Hence, the information model hides storage and implementation details that are not of interest to most database users, so unnecessary complications are hidden from them.

Approach-3 :

Support for Multiple Views of the Data :

A database sometimes has many users, each of whom may require a special perspective or view of the database.

A view could also be a subset of the database, or it’s going to contain virtual data that is derived from the database files but isn’t explicitly stored.

Some users might not get to remember whether the information they ask for is stored or derived.

A multi-user DBMS whose users have a spread of distinct applications must provide facilities for outlining multiple views. This provides many benefits for large databases such as the Aadhaar database.

Approach-4 :

Sharing of knowledge and Multi-user Transaction Processing :

A multi-user DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the database at an equivalent time or concurrently.

This is often essential if data for multiple applications is to be integrated and maintained during a single database such as the latest feature of WhatsApp integration with Facebook.

The DBMS must implement concurrency control in the software to make sure that several users trying to update equivalent data do so in a controlled manner in order that the results of the updates are correct.

For instance, when several reservation agents attempt to assign a seat on an airline flight, the DBMS should make sure that each seat is often accessed by just one user agent at a single time for an assignment to a passenger.

These sorts of applications are generally called online transaction processing (OLTP) applications. A fundamental role of multi-user DBMS software is to make sure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and efficiently with no inconsistency.

The concept of a transaction has become central to several database applications. A transaction is an executing program or process that has one or more database accesses, like reading or updating of database records or inserting new records.

The isolation property ensures that every transaction appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, many transactions could also be executed concurrently without affecting each other.

The atomicity property ensures that either all the database operations during a transaction are executed or none are, these all ACID properties we know.

## 7) Explain the different categories of data models.

### Data Model

Data Model gives us an idea that how the final system will look like after its complete implementation. It defines the data elements and the relationships between the data elements. Data Models are used to show how data is stored, connected, accessed and updated in the database management system. Here, we use a set of symbols and text to represent the information so that members of the organisation can communicate and understand it. Though there are many data models being used nowadays but the Relational model is the most widely used model. Apart from the Relational model, there are many other types of data models about which we will study in details in this blog. Some of the Data Models in DBMS are:

1.  Hierarchical Model

2.  Network Model

3.  Entity-Relationship Model

4.  Relational Model

5.  Object-Oriented Data Model

6.  Object-Relational Data Model

7.  Flat Data Model

8.  Semi-Structured Data Model

9.  Associative Data Model

10. Context Data Model

#### Hierarchical Model

Hierarchical Model was the first DBMS model. This model organises the data in the hierarchical tree structure. The hierarchy starts from the root which has root data and then it expands in the form of a tree adding child node to the parent node. This model easily represents some of the real-world relationships like food recipes, sitemap of a website etc. Example: We can represent the relationship between the shoes present on a shopping website in the following way:

**Features of a Hierarchical Model**

- _One-to-many relationship_: The data here is organised in a tree-like structure where the one-to-many relationship is between the datatypes. Also, there can be only one path from parent to any node. Example: In the above example, if we want to go to the node sneakers we only have one path to reach there i.e through men's shoes node.

- _Parent-Child Relationship_: Each child node has a parent node but a parent node can have more than one child node. Multiple parents are not allowed.

- _Deletion Problem_: If a parent node is deleted then the child node is automatically deleted.

- _Pointers_: Pointers are used to link the parent node with the child node and are used to navigate between the stored data. Example: In the above example the 'shoes' node points to the two other nodes 'women shoes' node and 'men's shoes' node.

**Advantages of Hierarchical Model**

- It is very simple and fast to traverse through a tree-like structure.

- Any change in the parent node is automatically reflected in the child node so, the integrity of data is maintained.

**Disadvantages of Hierarchical Model**

- Complex relationships are not supported.

- As it does not support more than one parent of the child node so if we have some complex relationship where a child node needs to have two parent node then that can't be represented using this model.

- If a parent node is deleted then the child node is automatically deleted.

#### Network Model

This model is an extension of the hierarchical model. It was the most popular model before the relational model. This model is the same as the hierarchical model, the only difference is that a record can have more than one parent. It replaces the hierarchical tree with a graph. Example: In the example below we can see that node student has two parents i.e. CSE Department and Library. This was earlier not possible in the hierarchical model.

**Features of a Network Model**

- _Ability to Merge more Relationships_: In this model, as there are more relationships so data is more related. This model has the ability to manage one-to-one relationships as well as many-to-many relationships.

- _Many paths_: As there are more relationships so there can be more than one path to the same record. This makes data access fast and simple.

- _Circular Linked List_: The operations on the network model are done with the help of the circular linked list. The current position is maintained with the help of a program and this position navigates through the records according to the relationship.

**Advantages of Network Model**

- The data can be accessed faster as compared to the hierarchical model. This is because the data is more related in the network model and there can be more than one path to reach a particular node. So the data can be accessed in many ways.

- As there is a parent-child relationship so data integrity is present. Any change in parent record is reflected in the child record.

**Disadvantages of Network Model**

- As more and more relationships need to be handled the system might get complex. So, a user must be having detailed knowledge of the model to work with the model.

- Any change like updation, deletion, insertion is very complex.

#### Entity-Relationship Model

Entity-Relationship Model or simply ER Model is a high-level data model diagram. In this model, we represent the real-world problem in the pictorial form to make it easy for the stakeholders to understand. It is also very easy for the developers to understand the system by just looking at the ER diagram. We use the ER diagram as a visual tool to represent an ER Model. ER diagram has the following three components:

Entities: Entity is a real-world thing. It can be a person, place, or even a concept. Example: Teachers, Students, Course, Building, Department, etc are some of the entities of a School Management System.

Attributes: An entity contains a real-world property called attribute. This is the characteristics of that attribute. Example: The entity teacher has the property like teacher id, salary, age, etc.

Relationship: Relationship tells how two attributes are related. Example: Teacher works for a department.

Example:

In the above diagram, the entities are Teacher and Department. The attributes of Teacher entity are Teacher_Name, Teacher_id, Age, Salary, Mobile_Number. The attributes of entity Department entity are Dept_id, Dept_name. The two entities are connected using the relationship. Here, each teacher works for a department.

Features of ER Model

Graphical Representation for Better Understanding: It is very easy and simple to understand so it can be used by the developers to communicate with the stakeholders.

ER Diagram: ER diagram is used as a visual tool for representing the model.

Database Design: This model helps the database designers to build the database and is widely used in database design.

Advantages of ER Model

Simple: Conceptually ER Model is very easy to build. If we know the relationship between the attributes and the entities we can easily build the ER Diagram for the model.

Effective Communication Tool: This model is used widely by the database designers for communicating their ideas.

Easy Conversion to any Model: This model maps well to the relational model and can be easily converted relational model by converting the ER model to the table. This model can also be converted to any other model like network model, hierarchical model etc.

Disadvatages of ER Model

No industry standard for notation: There is no industry standard for developing an ER model. So one developer might use notations which are not understood by other developers.

Hidden information: Some information might be lost or hidden in the ER model. As it is a high-level view so there are chances that some details of information might be hidden.

#### Relational Model

Relational Model is the most widely used model. In this model, the data is maintained in the form of a two-dimensional table. All the information is stored in the form of row and columns. The basic structure of a relational model is tables. So, the tables are also called relations in the relational model. Example: In this example, we have an Employee table.

Features of Relational Model

Tuples: Each row in the table is called tuple. A row contains all the information about any instance of the object. In the above example, each row has all the information about any specific individual like the first row has information about John.

Attribute or field: Attributes are the property which defines the table or relation. The values of the attribute should be from the same domain. In the above example, we have different attributes of the employee like Salary, Mobile_no, etc.

Advnatages of Relational Model

Simple: This model is more simple as compared to the network and hierarchical model.

Scalable: This model can be easily scaled as we can add as many rows and columns we want.

Structural Independence: We can make changes in database structure without changing the way to access the data. When we can make changes to the database structure without affecting the capability to DBMS to access the data we can say that structural independence has been achieved.

Disadvantages of Relatinal Model

Hardware Overheads: For hiding the complexities and making things easier for the user this model requires more powerful hardware computers and data storage devices.

Bad Design: As the relational model is very easy to design and use. So the users don't need to know how the data is stored in order to access it. This ease of design can lead to the development of a poor database which would slow down if the database grows.

But all these disadvantages are minor as compared to the advantages of the relational model. These problems can be avoided with the help of proper implementation and organisation.

#### Object-Oriented Data Model

The real-world problems are more closely represented through the object-oriented data model. In this model, both the data and relationship are present in a single structure known as an object. We can store audio, video, images, etc in the database which was not possible in the relational model(although you can store audio and video in relational database, it is adviced not to store in the relational database). In this model, two are more objects are connected through links. We use this link to relate one object to other objects. This can be understood by the example given below.

In the above example, we have two objects Employee and Department. All the data and relationships of each object are contained as a single unit. The attributes like Name, Job_title of the employee and the methods which will be performed by that object are stored as a single object. The two objects are connected through a common attribute i.e the Department_id and the communication between these two will be done with the help of this common id.

### Object-Relational Model

As the name suggests it is a combination of both the relational model and the object-oriented model. This model was built to fill the gap between object-oriented model and the relational model. We can have many advanced features like we can make complex data types according to our requirements using the existing data types. The problem with this model is that this can get complex and difficult to handle. So, proper understanding of this model is required.

#### Flat Data Model

It is a simple model in which the database is represented as a table consisting of rows and columns. To access any data, the computer has to read the entire table. This makes the modes slow and inefficient.

#### Semi-Structured Model

Semi-structured model is an evolved form of the relational model. We cannot differentiate between data and schema in this model. Example: Web-Based data sources which we can't differentiate between the schema and data of the website. In this model, some entities may have missing attributes while others may have an extra attribute. This model gives flexibility in storing the data. It also gives flexibility to the attributes. Example: If we are storing any value in any attribute then that value can be either atomic value or a collection of values.

#### Associative Data Model

Associative Data Model is a model in which the data is divided into two parts. Everything which has independent existence is called as an entity and the relationship among these entities are called association. The data divided into two parts are called items and links.

Item: Items contain the name and the identifier(some numeric value).

Links: Links contain the identifier, source, verb and subject.

Example: Let us say we have a statement "The world cup is being hosted by London from 30 May 2020". In this data two links need to be stored:

The world cup is being hosted by London. The source here is 'the world cup', the verb 'is being' and the target is 'London'.

...from 30 May 2020. The source here is the previous link, the verb is 'from' and the target is '30 May 2020'.

This is represented using the table as follows:

#### Context Data Model

Context Data Model is a collection of several models. This consists of models like network model, relational models etc. Using this model we can do various types of tasks which are not possible using any model alone.

## 8) Explain the three level DBMS architecture with a neat diagram, Why do we need mappings between schema levels? Explain mappings in DBMS architecture.

## 9) Write a note on various types of end users who use DBMS.

End users are basically those people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating and generating reports. The database primarily exists for their use. There are several categories of end users these are as follows:

1.  Casual End Users –

These are the users who occasionally access the database but they require different information each time. They use a sophisticated database query language basically to specify their request and are typically middle or level managers or other occasional browsers. These users learn very few facilities that they may use repeatedly from the multiple facilities provided by DBMS to access it.

2.  Naive or parametric end users –

These are the users who basically make up a sizeable portion of database end users. The main job function revolves basically around constantly querying and updating the database for this we basically use a standard type of query known as canned transaction that have been programmed and tested. These users need to learn very little about the facilities provided by the DBMS they basically have to understand the users’ interfaces of the standard transaction designed and implemented for their use. The following tasks are basically performed by Naive end users:

The person who is working in the bank will basically tell us the account balance and post-withdrawal and deposits.

Reservation clerks for airlines, railway, hotels, and car rental companies basically check availability for a given request and make the reservation.

Clerks who are working at receiving end for shipping companies enter the package identifies via barcodes and descriptive information through buttons to update a central database of received and in transit packages.

3.  Sophisticated end users –

These users basically include engineers, scientist, business analytics and others who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS in order to implement their application to meet their complex requirement. These users try to learn most of the DBMS facilities in order to achieve their complex requirements.

4.  Standalone users –

These are those users whose job is basically to maintain personal databases by using a ready-made program package that provides easy to use menu-based or graphics-based interfaces, An example is the user of a tax package that basically stores a variety of personal financial data of tax purposes. These users become very proficient in using a specific software package.

## 10) What is database? Explain the implicit properties of database.

Database is a collection of related data. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of people you know. This data can be recorded in an indexed address book or stored on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access, Excel, MySQL or Oracle.

A database has the following implicit properties:

1.  A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the mini- world or the universe of discourse (UoD). Changes to the mini-world are reflected in the database.

2.  A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database. For example, a list of random names cannot be considered a database but if we also note down those peoples’ addresses and phone numbers, then the data will have some inherent meaning (i.e. it will be an address book).

3.  A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested. For example, a department in a university might be interested in gathering data regarding the students’ GPA so that they can finalize the dean’s honor list.

## 11) Explain with sketch the different phases of database design.

### 1. Conceptual design

When every data requirement is stored and analyzed, the next thing that we need to do is creating a conceptual database plan. Here, a highly leveled conceptual data model is used. This phase is called _conceptual design_.

When the conceptual design phase is in progress, the basic data modeling operations can be deployed to define the high-level user operations that are noted during analysis of the functions.

### 2. Logical Design

The _logical phase_ of database design is also called the _data modeling mapping phase_. This phase gives us a result of relation schemas. The basis for these schemas is the ER or the Class Diagram.

To create the relation schemas is mainly mechanical operation. There are rules for transferring the ER model or class diagram to relation schemas.

### 3. Normalization

Normalization is, in fact, the last piece of the logical design puzzle. The main purpose of _normalization_ is to remove superfluity and every other potential anomaly during the update.

Normalization in database design is a way to change the relation schema to reduce any superfluity. With every normalization phase, a new table is added to the database.

### 4. Physical Design

The last phase of database design is the _physical design_ phase. In this phase, we implement the database design. Here, a DBMS (Database Management System) must be chosen to use.

For instance, different DBM systems have different names for every datatype and they have different data types.

SQL clauses are written to help in creating the database. Also, the indexes and the integrity constraints (rules) are defined in this phase. And finally the data is added and the database can finally be tested.

## 12) What are data base utilities? List the few functions that utilities perform.

Database utilities have the following types of functions:

1.  **Loading** : **A loading utility is used to load existing data files—such as text files or sequential files—into the database.** Usually, the current (source) format of the data file and the desired (target) database file structure are specified to the utility, which then automatically reformats the data and stores it in the database.With the proliferation of DBMSs, transferring data from one DBMS to another is becoming common in many organizations. Some vendors are offering products that generate the appropriate loading programs, given the existing source and target database storage descriptions (internal schemas). Such tools are also called conversion tools.

2.  **Backup**: A backup utility **creates a backup copy of the database,** usually by dumping the entire database onto tape or other mass storage medium. The backup copy can be used to restore the database in case of catastrophic disk failure. Incremental backups are also often used, where only changes since the previous backup are recorded. Incremental backup is more complex, but saves storage space.

3.  **Database storage reorganization**: This utility can be used **to reorganize a set of database files into different file organizations, and create new access paths to improve performance**.

4.  **Performance monitoring**: Such a utility **monitors database usage and provides statistics to the DBA**. The DBA uses the statistics in making decisions such as whether or not to reorganize files or whether to add or drop indexes to improve performance.

## 13) Distinguish between logical and physical data independence.

**1. Physical Data Independence :**  
The physical data independence is basically used to separate conceptual levels from the internal/physical levels. It is easy to achieve physical data independence. With this type of independence, user is able to change the physical storage structures or the devices which have an effect on the conceptual schema.

**Examples of changes under Physical Data Independence :**

- It is by the use of new storage device like Hard Drive or Magnetic Tapes
- Modifying the file organization technique in the Database
- Switching to different data structures.
- Changing the access method.
- Modifying indexes.
- To change the compression techniques or hashing algorithms.
- To change the Location of Database from say C drive to D Drive.

**2. Logical Data Independence :**  
Logical Data Independence is used to change the conceptual scheme without changing the following things :

- External views
- External API or programs

**Examples of changes under Logical Data Independence :**

- To Add/Modify/Delete a new attribute, entity or relationship is possible without a rewrite of existing application programs
- Merging two records into one
- To break an existing record i.e to divide the record into two or more records

## 14) List and explain types of DBMS?

### Two types of database structure

Databases typically have one of two basic forms:

- single-file or flat file database
- multi-file relational or structured database

A **flat file database** stores data in a plain text file, with each line of text typically holding one record. Delimiters such as commas or tabs separate fields. A flat file database uses a simple structure and, unlike a relational database, cannot contain multiple tables and relations.

A **relational database** contains multiple tables of data with rows and columns that relate to each other through special key fields. These databases are more flexible than flat file structures, and provide functionality for reading, creating, updating, and deleting data. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) - a standard user application that provides an easy programming interface for database interaction.
