## Arrays

JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an array and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.

```js
let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);
// → 5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);
// → 2
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);
// → 3
```

### 29. What's the output?

```javascript
const a = {};
const b = { key: 'b' };
const c = { key: 'c' };

a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;

console.log(a[b]);
```

- A: `123`
- B: `456`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object `a`, with the value of `123`.

However, when we stringify an object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. So what we are saying here, is that `a["[object Object]"] = 123`. Then, we can try to do the same again. `c` is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, `a["[object Object]"] = 456`.

Then, we log `a[b]`, which is actually `a["[object Object]"]`. We just set that to `456`, so it returns `456`.

## Objects

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

- Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Dates are always objects
- Maths are always objects
- Regular expressions are always objects
- Arrays are always objects
- Functions are always objects
- Objects are always objects

Objects are Variables

### 7. What's the output?

```javascript
let a = 3;
let b = new Number(3);
let c = 3;

console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
console.log(b === c);
```

- A: `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `false` `true`
- C: `true` `false` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.

When we use the `==` operator, it only checks whether it has the same _value_. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.

However, when we use the `===` operator, both value _and_ type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an **object**. Both return `false.`

### 10. What happens when we do this?

```javascript
function bark() {
  console.log("Woof!");
}

bark.animal = "dog";
```

- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.

</p>
</details>

Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue",
};
```

It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.

> JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods.

## Properties

Almost all JavaScript values have properties. The exceptions are null and undefined.

The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.

```js
null.length;
// → TypeError: null has no properties

const values = {
  1: "Hello world",
  "John Doe": "Present",
  city: "Hubli",
};

console.log(values[2 - 1]);
console.log(values["John Doe"]);
console.log(values.city);
```

The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. Both value.x and value[x] access a property on value—but not necessarily the same property. The difference is in how x is interpreted. When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name.

### 5. Which one is true?

```javascript
const bird = {
  size: "small",
};

const mouse = {
  name: "Mickey",
  small: true,
};
```

- A: `mouse.bird.size` is not valid
- B: `mouse[bird.size]` is not valid
- C: `mouse[bird["size"]]` is not valid
- D: All of them are valid

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true`

However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.

</p>
</details>

## Methods

Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.

An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

```js
let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
sequence.push(4);
sequence.push(5);
console.log(sequence);
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(sequence.pop());
// → 5
console.log(sequence);
// → [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Mutability

Mutable is a type of variable that can be changed. In JavaScript, only objects and arrays are mutable, not primitive values.

You can make a variable name point to a new value, but the previous value is still held in memory.

A **mutable object** is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.

**Immutables** are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.

**Strings** and **Numbers** are Immutable. Lets understand this with an example:

```js
var immutableString = "Hello";

// In the above code, a new object with string value is created.

immutableString = immutableString + "World";

// We are now appending "World" to the existing value.
```

On appending the "immutableString" with a string value, following events occur:

1. Existing value of "immutableString" is retrieved
2. "World" is appended to the existing value of "immutableString"
3. The resultant value is then allocated to a new block of memory
4. "immutableString" object now points to the newly created memory space
5. Previously created memory space is now available for garbage collection.

```js
const score = { visitors: 0, home: 0 };
// This is okay
score.visitors = 1;
// This isn't allowed
score = { visitors: 1, home: 1 };
```

### 6. What's the output?

```javascript
let c = { greeting: "Hey!" };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = "Hello";
console.log(d.greeting);
```

- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

When you change one object, you change all of them.

</p>
</details>
## JavaScript Object Prototypes

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

```js
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.nationality = "English";
const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

// you can not add a new property to an existing object constructor:
myFather.nationality;
// undefined
```

`Date` objects inherit from `Date.prototype`
`Array` objects inherit from `Array.prototype`
`Person` objects inherit from `Person.prototype`
The `Object.prototype` is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

`Date` objects, `Array` objects, and `Person` objects inherit from `Object.prototype`.

### Adding Properties and Methods to Objects

Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to all existing objects of a given type.

Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to an object constructor.

#### Using the prototype Property

---
### 14. All object have prototypes.

- A: true
- B: false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

All objects have prototypes, except for the **base object**. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the `new` keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as `.toString`. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.

</p>
</details>
---

The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to object constructors:

```js
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.prototype.nationality = "English";

const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

myFather.nationality;
// 'English'
```

> Only modify your own prototypes. Never modify the prototypes of standard JavaScript objects.

### 11. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const member = new Person("Lydia", "Hallie");
Person.getFullName = function () {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};

console.log(member.getFullName());
```

- A: `TypeError`
- B: `SyntaxError`
- C: `Lydia Hallie`
- D: `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method `getFullName` gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call `Person.getFullName()`, but `member.getFullName` throws a `TypeError`.

If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:

```js
Person.prototype.getFullName = function () {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};
```

###### 28. What's the output?

```javascript
String.prototype.giveLydiaPizza = () => {
  return 'Just give Lydia pizza already!';
};

const name = 'Lydia';

name.giveLydiaPizza();
```

- A: `"Just give Lydia pizza already!"`
- B: `TypeError: not a function`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`String` is a built-in constructor, which we can add properties to. I just added a method to its prototype. Primitive strings are automatically converted into a string object, generated by the string prototype function. So, all strings (string objects) have access to that method!
