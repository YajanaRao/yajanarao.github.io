<Info {...frontmatter} />

Rural Hostels means a place where students are lodging for there education. These places will almost Deserted with no habitation. Like in horror movies the buildings will be old, big, and completely covered by the fence boundaries. Every hostelians will be scared for the structure only, for the first time.

   In these places have some of the different culture compared to the society outside. Having 7 long years of hostel experience had give me some knowledge to speak about it.

Here Money does not play much rule in there life. the main things that influence there life's are Food, Sleep and Punishment.

There is a famous line " people will realize the value of food, when there are in Hostel ". yes friends that is true . I have sold chaklies, chips for 50 rupees, when I was in hostel. Its not only with home food even in hostel food chapathis were sold for sweets, papad were sold ground nuts. But remember in hostel every thing had a value, even a giver may be expecting the things like, help to do home work, or helping in exams/ tests and so on. There were also some groups my friends doing the business of washing cloths for chapathis or sweets.

The worst time of every morning is the time to wake up, if it is 9 or 10 its fine, but no one in the word like to get up at 5 or 6 in the morning, it is like a hell. Sleeping is major requirement for growing children, if they are made to have minimum hour of sleep, they have to find other ways for doing it.

There is a Art called Doze in hostel. doze means "The frequent to and fro motion of upper part of the body without the involvement of the mind, regarding sleep." It may be a shame out side, but it is art here. If you're dozing with minimum moments you are good in dozing, if you know to sleep without any indication, then you're the best.


Punishment are the major horror sources for hostel students, even the punishment will depend upon the creativity and cruelty of the teachers, some like beating, standing for hours in single leg, sit up, like physical punishments and writing pages together continuously were also given as punishments. whatever the punishments may be hostelians always searched for minimizing the pain.

Hostels are the major source of creativity, fun and friendship. those years of hostel days were always a reason to smile in future
