Amor fati is a Latin phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate"

Whatever that happened to our life, we should accept it. Accepting fate does not stop us from doing what is needed for in the present movement. For all the wrongs of the past, we have to take them as problems to be solved. In this way we don't dodge problems, we face them head on.

Dissatisfaction with the past is a sign of not accepting what happened which can lead to not seeing reality as it is.
