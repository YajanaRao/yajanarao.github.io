## Abundance

Deutsch's perspective is rooted in the idea of the "infinity of knowledge," which suggests that there are infinite possibilities for human progress and problem-solving. From this viewpoint, scarcity mindset, which is characterized by a belief in limited resources and opportunities, might be seen as a misconception or a failure to recognize the abundance of potential solutions and opportunities available.

Abundance mindset is a view of looking at life that there is enough for everyone.
Be the expression of abundance instead of scarcity. Even if you have less be the beacon of giving. All it needs is a mindset of abundance.

Give away your ideas,
Give away for time for good cause
Give away money for worth adventures
Be all that is required for your friends.

Walk like king even if you are in poverty

Abundance is the reflection of gratitude. For those for whom life is a gift anything that they do is an expression abundance.

## Slow Productivity

Recognising finitude is the initial point of the discussion as they will always be things that remains undone howmuch we try.

Write at-least 100 words every day.

Think of life as a journey, like an adventure, where you strive without losing your peace. It's like traveling without a set destination, because where you end up often surprises you.
 
Every new theory is a journey which was started from a point where theory was not really in the horizon. Along the way, we make mistakes, take detours, and eventually find ourselves at a point that leaves everyone amazed. But remember, that point isn't the final destination or the ultimate truth.

Realizing there isn't one truth or final destination is freeing. We need not search for a singular purpose or ultimate truth because our journey is an ongoing exploration of the infinite possibilities that await us. We stand at the precipice of an endless journeyâ€”an infinite unfolding of discovery, growth, and transformation.

## Uncertainity.

One of the basic learning would be to be comfortable with uncertainity. History looks organized and obvious when we look back, but when we are in the moment, it is uncertain. Reality is a complex soup. Every action leads to a reaction and on top level it is impossible to predict the outcome.

## Authentic vs Professional

The world demands us to be professional. It does not matter who we are interacting with, a level of abstraction and standard is required. where as being authentical is raw and it is for you to experience. When it has to be communicated with the world some amount of sophistication and professionalising is required. So don't expect the world to get used to your authenticity instead build a level or perfessionalism which can effectively resolve the purpose we are working together.
