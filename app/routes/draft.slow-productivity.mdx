Recognising finitude is the initial point of the discussion as they will always be things that remains undone howmuch we try.

Write at-least 100 words every day.

Think of life as a journey, like an adventure, where you strive without losing your peace. It's like traveling without a set destination, because where you end up often surprises you.
 
Every new theory is a journey which was started from a point where theory was not really in the horizon. Along the way, we make mistakes, take detours, and eventually find ourselves at a point that leaves everyone amazed. But remember, that point isn't the final destination or the ultimate truth.

Realizing there isn't one truth or final destination is freeing. We need not search for a singular purpose or ultimate truth because our journey is an ongoing exploration of the infinite possibilities that await us. We stand at the precipice of an endless journeyâ€”an infinite unfolding of discovery, growth, and transformation.
