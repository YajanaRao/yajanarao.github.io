> Problems are inevitable. Problems are solvable. Solutions create new problems, which must be solved in their turn.
 ~David Deutsch

We are surrouned with problems. Scientic Problems, Political Problems, Climate Problems, Persoanl Problems, etc. But the one thing that is common among all of them is that they are solvable. The key to solving any problem is by creatively guess solutions to it. And critise those solutions to improve upon them.

Progress arises from bold thinking and a willingness to entertain seemingly audacious ideas to the problems that we are facing. Throughout history, many groundbreaking innovations and paradigm shifts have emerged from individuals who dared to challenge conventional wisdom and imagine possibilities that others deemed improbable or even impossible.

As our knowledge is always incomplete. All of our critisisms failing is all we have to know that a given idea is true compared to it's competators. We have to be able to make bold conjectures and be comfortable with the imperfections in our ideas. Willigness critise ideas and improved upon.
