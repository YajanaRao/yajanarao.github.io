## Abundance

Deutsch's perspective is rooted in the idea of the "infinity of knowledge," which suggests that there are infinite possibilities for human progress and problem-solving. From this viewpoint, scarcity mindset, which is characterized by a belief in limited resources and opportunities, might be seen as a misconception or a failure to recognize the abundance of potential solutions and opportunities available.

Abundance mindset is a view of looking at life that there is enough for everyone.
Be the expression of abundance instead of scarcity. Even if you have less be the beacon of giving. All it needs is a mindset of abundance.

Give away your ideas,
Give away for time for good cause
Give away money for worth adventures
Be all that is required for your friends.

Walk like king even if you are in poverty

Abundance is the reflection of gratitude. For those for whom life is a gift anything that they do is an expression abundance.
