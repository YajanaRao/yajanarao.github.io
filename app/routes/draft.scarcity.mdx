Deutsch's perspective is rooted in the idea of the "infinity of knowledge," which suggests that there are infinite possibilities for human progress and problem-solving. From this viewpoint, scarcity mindset, which is characterized by a belief in limited resources and opportunities, might be seen as a misconception or a failure to recognize the abundance of potential solutions and opportunities available.
